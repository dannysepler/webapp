### Before running the app

Here's what you need to do:

1. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed. 
2. Now clone the source code in the terminal.
3. Go into the source code folder on terminal, and type in the following commands.
..* "npm install express"
..* "npm install nodemon"
..* (this tells the [node package manager](https://npmjs.org/) to get these packages. Express is the Node framework this app is built in. Nodemon allows the server to update instantaneously, so you don't have to keep restarting your local server. It's pretty great.)
4. Run the app with "nodemon app.js". It should read "Express server listening on port {{Port #}}"
5. Please let me know if I missed any steps. Thanks!
